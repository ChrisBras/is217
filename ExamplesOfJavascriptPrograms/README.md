Below I will include the 5 examples of Javascript programs that I find interesting and why.

[Raphael.js](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/)
==========
Raphael is a JavaScript library that allows you to work with vector graphics. It uses SVG, which uses XML to define shapes. The best part is that the rpahics are part of the DOM. Therefore, they can be manipulated like any other element. 

[D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)
========
D3.js is a JavaScript visualization library for HTML and SVG. It links datasets to dom. Data Visualization is becomming a commodity for front-event development. More users want control of the data they have access to. D3.js allows a developer easily create visualizations with this dynamic data.

[Angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
============
Angular is a JavaScript framework that's goal is to allow developers to make single page applications using MVW. It used to be MVC, but most of these JavaScript MVC frameworks did not use a traditional controller. Some used a router approach for example. MVC for JS was eventually known as MV\*. The \* being a widcard for anything. Now, the industry us using MVW, much more. The W standing for Whatever. What sets angular part from all the MVW frameworks is that it tends to be smaller in code. Futhermore it is much more extensible and expansive, especially with templating. To be honest, I've only worked with backbone, but I'm interesting in using this in the future.

[Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node)
==========
Node.js is a JavasScript environment using the Chrome V8 engine. It allows javascript to be run outside of a browser. The best part of node is that it is non-blocking. An issue with node is that it lacks control of multi threaded systems. However, this is a JS limitation, not really a node issue. Furthermore, most server OS's have async I/O calls that automatically take advantage. I'm not sure of the implications. 

[Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman)
========
Yeoman is a set of tools and libraries that allow for a workflow. Javascript based development is finally maturing to a point that PHP and Ruby/Rails have been doing for years. Yeoman gives solutions such as package management oto download and install project dependencies. 

It also allows for scaffolding like rails, compiles coffeescript, lints code, built in preview server, and more. It offers a full webstack solution. 

Conclusion
----------
I would, at least, like to use yeoman to scaffold an angular.js project using node as the backend. It would be an awesome endeavour to use all JS to create a complete project. I've been experimenting with ruby/rails and python/django. The frameworks are very simple to implement, however it can become increasingly difficult to master the language it is written in. Since I want to concentrate in front-end development, I feel that every second I get better at ruby is a second I could have gotten better at javascript. It's always good to increase knowledge in many languages, however I doubt there will ever be another language for front end browser logic. if would not make sense for browsers to have multiple langauge processing engines.
