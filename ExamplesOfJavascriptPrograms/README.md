Below I will include the 5 examples of Javascript programs that I find interesting and why.

[Raphael.js][https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/]
==========
Raphael is a JavaScript library that allows you to work with vector graphics. It uses SVG, which uses XML to define shapes. The best part is that the rpahics are part of the DOM. Therefore, they can be manipulated like any other element. 

[D3.js][https://github.com/mbostock/d3]
========
D3.js is a JavaScript visualization library for HTML and SVG. It links datasets to dom. Data Visualization is becomming a commodity for front-event development. More users want control of the data they have access to. D3.js allows a developer easily create visualizations with this dynamic data.
